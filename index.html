                I'm Felix, a 17-year-old with a passion for computers. Ever since I started learning C++ 7 years ago, 
                I've been improving my skills in a range of languages. What I love most about coding, is getting something working from designing intuitive user 
                interfaces to  the backend of a login screen to building efficient algorithms that keep everything running smoothly.<br><br>
                Right now, I'm completing a T Level in Digital Production, Design & Development at Bournemouth & Poole College. 
                Here, I'm learning more about programming, web development,  data management, cybersecurity, and exploring the legal and ethical side of computing. 
                I'm working hard to build a future in software development, web development, or cybersecurity, but I'm always open to learning something 
                new!<br><br>
                Beyond programming, I enjoy snowboarding, climbing, and biking! I'm also love camera work, video editing, and 3D modeling.
